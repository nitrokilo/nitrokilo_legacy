			<p> Every day I wake <br>
				Every breathe I take <br>
				A subtle felling I get <br>
				Because I am in debt <br>

			</p>
			<p>
				Not a financial debt <br>
				If that were the case, I would be a cadet <br>
				A debt to myself, this burden is <br>
				A painful feeling it presents, like that of a pop quiz <br>

				
			</p>
			<p>
			No one likes a pop quiz  <br>
			Same way no one likes their soda with extra fizz <br>
			This matter clouds my mind <br>
			So much so I swear I’m going blind <br>
		</p>


			<p>
				Okay maybe I’m not going blind <br>
				I just feel hella confined <br>
				Like I ain’t a mastermind <br>
				Sometimes I feel like I gotta save humankind <br>


				
			</p>
			<p>

				Why do I have to save humankind? <br>
				Like is it so hard to show love and leave the hate behind? <br>
				Like why can’t we love one another? <br>
				Why can’t we treat everyone like they’re our brother?  <br>

			</p>
			<p>

				Even if you don’t have a biological brother <br>
				I know you love your mother <br>
				Why do we hate? <br>
				Do we think it’s the ultimate checkmate? <br>

			</p>
			<p>
				I promise you it’s not a checkmate <br>
				It’s really just an excuse for you not to accommodate <br>
				I’m saying spread love and share the cake <br>
				I promise you it’s not going to hurt like a bite from a snake <br>

			</p>
			<p>
				Tomorrow I shall wake <br>
				Many more breaths I hope to take <br>
				A world with more love I hope we exist in  <br>
				Or else all our efforts would have ended in the bin <br>
